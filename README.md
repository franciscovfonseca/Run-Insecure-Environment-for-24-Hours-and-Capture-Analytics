<br>

The next thing we're going to do is just let our Environment sit as it is right now ‚ûú with everything Running in an Insecure Way.

We're going to let it run like that for 24 hours.

And then we'll come back after a day and **Take a Snapshot of the last 24 hours**.

We're going to record how many of the following Logs we had in the last 24 hours:

- ```SecurityEvent```
- ```Syslog```
- ```SecurityAlert```
- ```SecurityIncident```
- ```AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL```

<br>

After that,we'll start addressing a few of the Incidents and Lockdown our Environment quite a bit.

We'll do this by Practicing Security and **Implementing Security Controls**.

Finally, when our Environment is sufficiently Secured ‚ûú we're going to wait another 24 Hours and **Take another Snapshot then**.

We'll compare the 2 Environments to show what impact **Implementing Security Control** can had in our Environment.

The goal now is to **Expose our Environment to Malicious Traffic for 24 hours** in order to **Build 4 Attack Maps for**:

> üîπ Failed Authentication against **Windows WMs** (RDP / SMB / General Authentication Failures)
> 
> üîπ Failed Authentication against **Linux VM** (SSH)
> 
> üîπ Failed Authentication to the **Microsoft SQL Server** (inside our Windows VM)
>
> üîπ Malicious Inbound Flows for the **Network Security Groups**
> 
> 

<br>

üí° The Following Table shows the Measurements taken from the Insecure Environment after the Initial 24 Hour' Observation Period:

<br>

### ‚û°Ô∏è Metrics BEFORE Securing our Environment

<br>

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent (Windows VM)            | 19470
| Syslog (Linux VM)                   | 3028
| SecurityAlert (Microsoft Defender for Cloud)            | 10
| SecurityIncident (Sentinel Incidents)        | 348
| NSG Inbound Malicious Flows Allowed | 843

<br>

<br>

### ‚û°Ô∏è Attack Maps BEFORE Hardening / Security Controls

<br>

> We're now going to take some **Screenshots of the Attack Maps** we made earlier.
> 
> We'll be able to see what the Maps look like **BEFORE** and **AFTER** we **Implement the Security Controls** and tighten down our Environment.

<br>

Before taking the screenshots ‚ûú the Workbooks need to be edited to only show the **Last 24 hours**.

üí° The query runs over the last 30 days by default.

# Summary

<br>

In the next Lab we're going to start **Working the Incidents** and **Securing our Environment**.

We'll go through the **Incident Response Lifecycle** ‚ûú remediating problems that were found.

After that Incident Response phase ‚ûú we'll add more **Security Controls** to our Environment and harden it some more.

Finally we'll take another 24 Hour' Snapshot of our Environment's Attack Metrics and make a comparison with the previous results.
